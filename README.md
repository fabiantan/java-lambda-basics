# Kinesis Java Record Aggregator Test Producers

This project contains a number of sample executable Java classes that demonstrate different methods of publishing records to Amazon Kinesis.

## Runnable Classes

This project provides three different runnable Java classes for publishing data to Amazon Kinesis:

`SampleNormalProducer.java` - Uses a standard Kinesis `PutRecords` call to send records to the Kinesis stream in a single batch.

`SampleKPLProducer.java` - Uses the official Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) to send records to the Kinesis stream as aggregated records.

`SampleAggregatorProducer.java` - Uses the `KinesisAggregator` project from this repository to create aggregated records and send them to Kinesis.

## Run Instructions

1. Build the project with Maven: `mvn install`

2. The producers rely on the Java [DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html) to set permissions.  You must supply credentials that have Put* access to the Kinesis stream you specify.  See [Using the Default Credential Provider Chain] (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSdkDocsJava/latest/DeveloperGuide/credentials.html#id1) for the various methods you can use to supply AWS credentials.

3.  The command to run the producers is of the form:

`java -cp target/KinesisTestProducers-1.0.jar com.amazonaws.kinesis.producer.<ProducerClassName> <streamName> <region>` 

E.g.:

`java -cp target/KinesisTestProducers-1.0.jar com.amazonaws.kinesis.producer.SampleNormalProducer myStreamName us-east-1`

## Configuring Runtime Behavior

The supplied `ProducerConfig.java` class is a simple configuration shared by the various sample producer applications mentioned above.  You can tune the `RECORD SIZE BYTES` variable to control how big each transmitted user record is and you can use the `RECORDS_TO_TRANSMIT` variable to control how many records are sent during each run of the application.

## Sample Record

The sample records sent by these applications look like this:

```
RECORD 42 wajbxagglpzpbuxfoeoxznhwlrrxhsnnfjkprznvxedqfxpqucfbwaiudhkgzbzmdamsjkezcfrrredlfndbudldudfipzkar
```

The `RECORD_SIZE_BYTES` variable in `ProducerConfig.java` file will control how big the records are (the bigger the record size, the longer the random character string at the end of the record).
